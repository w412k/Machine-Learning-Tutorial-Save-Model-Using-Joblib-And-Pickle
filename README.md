# Saving and Loading Trained Model using Pickle and Joblib Library

This repository contains a practice exercise for the About Machine Learning tutorial on saving and loading trained models using the Pickle and Joblib libraries. The exercise focuses on using a custom-made dataset about home prices, with columns for area and price.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this practice exercise is a custom-made dataset about home prices. It includes the following columns:

- **Area**: Represents the area (in square feet) of a home.
- **Price**: Represents the corresponding price (in dollars) of the home.

Please note that this dataset is a simplified example for learning purposes.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files:

- **train_model.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the process of training a machine learning model on the home prices dataset and saving it using both the Pickle and Joblib libraries and showcases how to load the saved model and make predictions on new data.
- **data.csv**: The dataset file in CSV format.

## Dependencies

The practice exercise requires the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.x)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Pickle
- Joblib

Make sure to install the necessary libraries before running the provided notebooks.

## Instructions

To run the exercise, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
  - git clone [https://github.com/w412k/your-repo.git](https://github.com/w412k/Machine-Learning-Tutorial-Save-Model-Using-Joblib-And-Pickle.git)

2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab).

3. Run the `ipynb` notebook to train a machine learning model on the home prices dataset and save and load it using both the Pickle and Joblib libraries.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the provided code to deepen your understanding of saving and loading trained models.
